Use this template to bootstrap the creation of a TypeScript action. :rocket:

This template includes compilation support, tests, a validation workflow,
publishing, and versioning guidance.

If you are new, there's also a simpler introduction in the
[Hello world JavaScript action repository](https://github.com/actions/hello-world-javascript-action).

## Create Your Own Action

To create your own action, you can use this repository as a template! Just
follow the below instructions:

1. Click the **Use this template** button at the top of the repository
1. Select **Create a new repository**
1. Select an owner and name for your new repository
1. Click **Create repository**
1. Clone your new repository

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Make sure to remove or update the [`CODEOWNERS`](./CODEOWNERS) file! For
> details on how to use this file, see
> [About code owners](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).

## Initial Setup

After you've cloned the repository to your local machine or codespace, you'll
need to perform some initial setup steps before you can develop your action.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You'll need to have a reasonably modern version of
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) handy (20.x or later should work!). If you are
> using a version manager like [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or
> [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), this template has a `.node-version`
> file at the root of the repository that will be used to automatically switch
> to the correct version when you `cd` into the repository. Additionally, this
> `.node-version` file is used by GitHub Actions in any `actions/setup-node`
> actions.

1. :hammer_and_wrench: Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. :building_construction: Package the TypeScript for distribution

   ```bash
   npm run bundle
   ```

1. :white_check_mark: Run the tests

   ```bash
   $ npm test

   PASS  ./index.test.js
     ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
     ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
     ✓ test runs (95ms)

   ...
   ```

## Update the Action Metadata

The [`action.yml`](action.yml) file defines metadata about your action, such as
input(s) and output(s). For details about this file, see
[Metadata syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions).

When you copy this repository, update `action.yml` with the name, description,
inputs, and outputs for your action.

## Update the Action Code

The [`src/`](./src/) directory is the heart of your action! This contains the
source code that will be run when your action is invoked. You can replace the
contents of this directory with your own code.

There are a few things to keep in mind when writing your action code:

- Most GitHub Actions toolkit and CI/CD operations are processed asynchronously.
  In `main.ts`, you will see that the action is run in an `async` function.

  ```javascript
  import * as core from "@actions/core";
  //...

  async function run() {
    try {
      //...
    } catch (error) {
      core.setFailed(error.message);
    }
  }
  ```

  For more information about the GitHub Actions toolkit, see the
  [documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md).

So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and start customizing your action!

1. Create a new branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b releases/v1
   ```

1. Replace the contents of `src/` with your action code
1. Add tests to `__tests__/` for your source code
1. Format, test, and build the action

   ```bash
   npm run all
   ```

   > This step is important! It will run [`ncc`](https://github.com/vercel/ncc)
   > to build the final JavaScript action code with all dependencies included.
   > If you do not run this step, your action will not work correctly when it is
   > used in a workflow. This step also includes the `--license` option for
   > `ncc`, which will create a license file for all of the production node
   > modules used in your project.

1. Commit your changes

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "My first action is ready!"
   ```

1. Push them to your repository

   ```bash
   git push -u origin releases/v1
   ```

1. Create a pull request and get feedback on your action
1. Merge the pull request into the `main` branch

Your action is now published! :rocket:

For information about versioning your action, see
[Versioning](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)
in the GitHub Actions toolkit.

## Validate the Action

You can now validate the action by referencing it in a workflow file. For
example, [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) demonstrates how to reference an
action in the same repository.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    id: checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Test Local Action
    id: test-action
    uses: ./
    with:
      milliseconds: 1000

  - name: Print Output
    id: output
    run: echo "${{ steps.test-action.outputs.time }}"
```

For example workflow runs, check out the
[Actions tab](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions)! :rocket:

## Usage

After testing, you can create version tag(s) that developers can use to
reference different stable versions of your action. For more information, see
[Versioning](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)
in the GitHub Actions toolkit.

To include the action in a workflow in another repository, you can use the
`uses` syntax with the `@` symbol to reference a specific branch, tag, or commit
hash.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    id: checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Test Local Action
    id: test-action
    uses: actions/typescript-action@v1 # Commit with the `v1` tag
    with:
      milliseconds: 1000

  - name: Print Output
    id: output
    run: echo "${{ steps.test-action.outputs.time }}"
```

## Publishing a New Release

This project includes a helper script, [`script/release`](./script/release)
designed to streamline the process of tagging and pushing new releases for
GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions allows users to select a specific version of the action to use,
based on release tags. This script simplifies this process by performing the
following steps:

1. **Retrieving the latest release tag:** The script starts by fetching the most
   recent SemVer release tag of the current branch, by looking at the local data
   available in your repository.
1. **Prompting for a new release tag:** The user is then prompted to enter a new
   release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the tag retrieved in
   the previous step, and validates the format of the inputted tag (vX.X.X). The
   user is also reminded to update the version field in package.json.
1. **Tagging the new release:** The script then tags a new release and syncs the
   separate major tag (e.g. v1, v2) with the new release tag (e.g. v1.0.0,
   v2.1.2). When the user is creating a new major release, the script
   auto-detects this and creates a `releases/v#` branch for the previous major
   version.
1. **Pushing changes to remote:** Finally, the script pushes the necessary
   commits, tags and branches to the remote repository. From here, you will need
   to create a new release in GitHub so users can easily reference the new tags
   in their workflows.

# `@ubiquity/ts-template`

This template repository includes support for the following:

- TypeScript
- Environment Variables
- Conventional Commits
- Automatic deployment to Cloudflare Pages

## Testing

### Cypress

To test with Cypress Studio UI, run

```shell
yarn cy:open
```

Otherwise, to simply run the tests through the console, run

```shell
yarn cy:run
```

### Jest

To start Jest tests, run

```shell
yarn test
```

## Sync any repository to latest `ts-template`

A bash function that can do this for you:

```bash
sync-branch-to-template() {
  local branch_name
  branch_name=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  local original_remote
  original_remote=$(git remote show | head -n 1)

  # Add the template remote
  git remote add template https://github.com/ubiquity/ts-template

  # Fetch from the template remote
  git fetch template development

  if [ "$branch_name" != "HEAD" ]; then
    # Create a new branch and switch to it
    git checkout -b "chore/merge-${branch_name}-template"

    # Merge the changes from the template remote
    git merge template/development --allow-unrelated-histories

    # Switch back to the original branch
    git checkout "$branch_name"

    # Push the changes to the original remote
    git push "$original_remote" HEAD:"$branch_name"
  else
    echo "You are in a detached HEAD state. Please checkout a branch first."
  fi

  # Remove the template remote
  # git remote remove template
}
```
# `@ubiquity-os/plugin-template`

## Prerequisites

- A good understanding of how the [kernel](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot-kernel) works and how to interact with it.
- A basic understanding of the Ubiquibot configuration and how to define your plugin's settings.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository using this template.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install the dependencies preferably using `yarn` or `bun`.

## Creating a new plugin

- If your plugin is to be used as a slash command which should have faster response times as opposed to longer running GitHub action tasks, you should use the `worker` type.

1. Ensure you understand and have setup the [kernel](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot-kernel).
2. Update [compute.yml](./.github/workflows/compute.yml) with your plugin's name and update the `id`.
3. Update [context.ts](./src/types/context.ts) with the events that your plugin will fire on.
4. Update [manifest.json](./manifest.json) with a proper description of your plugin.
5. Update [plugin-inputs.ts](./src/types/plugin-inputs.ts) to match the `with:` settings in your org or repo level configuration.

- Your plugin config should look similar to this:

```yml
plugins:
  - name: hello-world
    id: hello-world
    uses:
      - plugin: http://localhost:4000
        with:
          # Define configurable items here and the kernel will pass these to the plugin.
          configurableResponse: "Hello, is it me you are looking for?"
          customStringsUrl: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubiquibot/plugin-template/development/strings.json"
```

###### At this stage, your plugin will fire on your defined events with the required settings passed in from the kernel. You can now start writing your plugin's logic.

6. Start building your plugin by adding your logic to the [plugin.ts](./src/plugin.ts) file.

## Testing a plugin

### Worker Plugins

- `yarn/bun worker` - to run the worker locally.
- To trigger the worker, `POST` requests to http://localhost:4000/ with an event payload similar to:

```ts
await fetch("http://localhost:4000/", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    stateId: "",
    eventName: "",
    eventPayload: "",
    settings: "",
    ref: "",
    authToken: "",
  }),
});
```

A full example can be found [here](https://github.com/ubiquibot/assistive-pricing/blob/623ea3f950f04842f2d003bda3fc7b7684e41378/tests/http/request.http).

#### Deploying the Worker
For testing purposes, the worker can be deployed through the Worker Deploy and Worker Delete workflows. It requires to
create a personal [Cloudflare Account](https://www.cloudflare.com/), and fill the `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` within your
GitHub Action Secrets.

### Action Plugins

- Ensure the kernel is running and listening for events.
- Fire an event in/to the repo where the kernel is installed. This can be done in a number of ways, the easiest being via the GitHub UI or using the GitHub API, such as posting a comment, opening an issue, etc in the org/repo where the kernel is installed.
- The kernel will process the event and dispatch it using the settings defined in your `.ubiquibot-config.yml`.
- The `compute.yml` workflow will run and execute your plugin's logic.
- You can view the logs in the Actions tab of your repo.

- [Ubiquibot V1](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot) - helpful for porting V1 functionality to V2, helper/utility functions, types, etc. Everything is based on the V1 codebase but with a more modular approach. When using V1 code, keep in mind that most all code will need refactored to work with the new V2 architecture.
